    <h1>About Little Bead Studio</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      Hi! I'm Julia — the maker, designer, and creative behind Little Bead
      Studio. I create handmade jewelry inspired by color, texture, and simple
      elegance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every piece is crafted carefully by hand, using quality beads, wire, and
      findings chosen for durability and beauty. Whether it's earrings,
      bracelets, or custom orders, my goal is to make jewelry that feels
      meaningful, personal, and fun to wear.
    </p>

    <p>
      What started as a small hobby quickly became a passion. I love
      experimenting with new designs, learning new techniques, and creating
      accessories that make people feel confident and unique.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for supporting my work — it means more than you know. I hope my
      pieces bring as much joy to you as creating them brings to me.
